put sing tenderly Dashing about in her wandering wear\;Sabre thrusting and shattering foes\;Few ever seek to know her woes\;And bring their comforting to bear\;And in their stinginess to sew\;They reap a harvest far below\;That for which he's' come to care.
pause 30
put sing tenderly A friendship true as bluest sky\; He thrills to know her beyond a flirt\; Less would leave his heart a desert\; Springless when she catches his eye\;
put hum romantic
pause 20
put sing tenderly A warrior, yes, but moreso I say\; His love, found dearest on this day.
