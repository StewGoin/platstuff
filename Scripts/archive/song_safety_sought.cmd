pause 5
put sing regretfully Perhaps not yet we see the reason\;That war comes at us from all directions,\;Bringing the deathly chill in season.\;Places once thought safe are naught\;Safety in the lover's arms is sought.
pause 18
put sing hopelessly Pirates, orcs, ogres and trolls:\;A multitude of enemies arrayed against us,\;For whom shall death's knell toll?\;Places once thought safe are not\;Safety in battle's arms is sought.
pause 18
put sing hesitantly Human, Eloth, Halfing and Elf:\;An old fractured alliance stands to stem the tide,\;Some for others fight, others fight for self.\;Places once thought safe are naught\;Fear, by companion's sides, is fought.
pause 18
put sing emphatically A wall upon which this storm shall break,\;Built in new trust and cast in deep bonds\;Zoluren, Ilithi and Therengia shall make.\;Places once thought safe are nought\;But shall be again, in loyalty wrought.
pause 18
put recite And so we end, though we go on\;The ground we fight for and bleed upon\;Belongs to us all, each race paid complete\;Let never our friendships end in deceit.
