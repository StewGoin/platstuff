pause 5
put sing mockingly Warrior chickens coming to our aid\; Thinking that the day again they have saved\; They focus on a frontal attack\; While we sneak behind them to stick a fork in their back
pause 18
put sing dreamily Warrior Chickens should know no other fate\; Than to end up baked or fried on my plate\; That wonderful smell of them roasting over a pit\; Eating so much that my pants will split!
pause 18
put sing cheerfully Warrior chickens, abound around.\; Dancing and pracing and pecking the ground.\; What do they peck? Corn kernels galore.\; Listen closely to learn chicken cooking lore!
pause 18
put sing cheerfully Salted steaks, and smoked pork meats\; Apple sauce boar, and pickled hogs feet.\; None of these sweet dishes compete\; With the tangy taste of chicken!
pause 18
put sing longingly Plucked naked of their feathers,\; a laughable sight\;Chickens are for eating,\; fry them up on sight.\;What goes better with beer,\; than some onions rings?\; Deep fried battered,\; Warrior chicken wings!
pause 28
put sing sternly But do not get ahead of yourself!\; I heard it from a Bardic Elf\; That chickens need to boil half a day\; But 'fore you drop them in\; You must their head remove from them.\; And as you swing your axe you need to say:
pause 10
put recite Warrior Chickens tied to the block\;Soon the axe to their neck will chop\;Warrior Chickens scream for salvation\;But it's mine, not theirs, saving me from starvation!"
pause 15
put sing sweetly A chicken stew, a noodle soup\; They all start in the chicken coup\; Eggs galore, we eat them up; Now set the table for our sup'!
pause 18
put sing emphatically Dessert must follow, chicken flambe\; and cornish hen in raspberry glaze\; Warrior chickens, they taste so grande\; The sweetest meat in all the land!
pause 15

put say BeGawk!
