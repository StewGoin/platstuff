#Poem - The Lonley Wanderer
#put playact start
#put playact recites to the rythm of his music
#put play lament solemn

pause 13
put sing By a lake, still in the morning Sun\; I look quietly at the sunrise on the glassy surface

pause 13
put sing A man lay nearby\; His time here nearly gone\; He stared into the empty sky\; Not yet aware of I

pause 13
put sing A wasted life he saw above\; With empty eyes and leaden heart\; No words left upon his lips\; No excuses remain

pause 13
put sing For time spent so frivolously\; Seeking all for self\; No hours left to right his wrongs\; As winds drew up to carry him on

#pause 13
#put playact walks about in animation, face contorted in a sarcastic glare

pause 13
put sing His future death beneath the waters\; Condemned to destruction\; No tear will be shed...\;He sees his sentence and grimly smiles\; For he has seen it before

pause 13
#put playact throws his head back in anguish, voice trembling with emotion

pause 2
put sing In horror I see his visage ripple\; With the coming of the wind\; I've seen the dead man's ghost who haunts me\; And tremble for I was him...

#pause 13
#put play closes his arms around himself and slowly sits down
#put sit
#put playact stop
