put recite The raising of the stones.
pause 3
 
put recite Four hundred and nine years before Lanival the redeemers victory a S'kra took control of the empire, The empress Merthamone Vanaya.
  
put recite A year later the bloodworm comet ripped across the Elanthian skies, and the Empress' estate in the Zaulflung was destroyed.
 
put recite Some speculate that whatever happened in the waste may have spilled into what is now the Zaulflung swamp, and that could have been the cause of the creation of the swamp itself.
 
put recite Sometime during the fall of the empress' estate, the interplanar barriers between the void and the plane of abiding begin to weaken, no one really knows why, but some attribute it to the comet, others says whatever caused the wasted lands caused it.
 
put recite This lead to a demon being able to slip through the void into our plane, at least partially when not physically, and that demon begin the destroy the area that became the Zaulflung, making itself a residence, building a fortress.
 
put recite Now legends say that this demon was not only of the void, but could well have been its ruler before the one god infused the 13, leaving the void to be infused into what became known as Urriem'tier.

put recite During this same time period a dwarven warmage was making himself well know as a mercenary, taking jobs for rebel lords and poking at their defenses and whatnot.
 
put recite Engaging in countless battles his fame quickly grew.
 
put recite Sometime before the fall of the empress state, the dwarf was "contracted" for life by the empress Merthamone Vanaya, in essence making him her personal errand boy.
 
put recite This of course was our captain Farn.

put recite The second: a man named Osneg Vanar, Osneg was from the far north, probably someplace beyond what we know abot, near the polar caps, though that was never confirmed.
 
put recite He was a warmage of immense power and no small reputation. It was hinted that he possessed the power of blackfire, and was the most skilled mana harnesser in history, rivaling Firulf himself.
 
put recite Which, if you study the stones, and some of the hints around the swamp, that could very well be what burned the black stone.
 
put recite The third: Lady Marshal Yavalche Ruahen, an Elothean paladin, scholar and strategist. She was a sister to Yeluenne who served as personal empath and chronicler to the Empress. It's possible that Yavalche worked for the Empress or Yeluenne's sister, Lady Marelanis. It's not entirely clear in the histories, and both theories are accepted.

put recite Yeluenne was suspected to be pregnant with Farn's child at the time of his death in the Zaulflung.
  
put recite The fourth: Poho Zhakrhhn, a S'kra of... interesting reputation. He was awarded the seven spears for saving the life of the empress.
 
put recite Less certain persons suspected to be part of the thirteen were Lady Marelanis, Lord Rothpen, a fortuneteller from the Fortune's Path sect, and others.
 
put recite And the grand figure of them all: The mad mage Sithia. She is a major player in the history of the stones. A note discovered by researchers gives her credit for the lost and forbidden lore that was used to craft the stones themselves.
 
put recite Others say she made them and gave them to Farn, what are facts is that she had something to do with the creation of the stones, that they were not able to be made without her help, and that she was present and the only known survivor of the thirteen who erected the stones.
 
put recite Osneg was supposedly a master of disguise and some say that he was able to pretend to be anyone, in fact several years ago a man wandered out of the swamp and claimed to be Osneg, but he was taken for a lunatic, locked away, and no one really knows what happened to him from there.
 
put recite Sithsia is a known necromancer, thus the forbidden, and most mysterious, knowledge came from her.
 
put recite And without going into her story, which starts somewhere around 500 years before Lanival, she's been a major player in the whole company and the events leading up to it.
