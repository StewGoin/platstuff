#Solstitia's Chicken Song
put sing matter-of-factly The mighty eagle, the valiant steed,\; None are as brave in times of need\; As the plucky, unplucked chicken\; Who lived in the care of a cute little girl.
pause 20

put sing matter-of-factly The girl thought he was just the same\; Another little chicken that she'd given a name.\; But beneath the feathered exterior lay,\; A chicken of purpose, who was planning
pause 20

put sing matter-of-factly He knew that his keeper was a smart little kitten\; It was important to his plan, that she be smitten.\; For him to escape cleanly, and carry it out\; She must think as simple as he could be.
pause 20

put sing matter-of-factly So he let slip no impression, of his internal scheming\; Hoping and hoping that she would be dreaming,\; While he slipped into the night with his puppet\; Behind him prepared to beguile the youngster.
pause 20

put sing matter-of-factly He flew away quickly, he had taught himself how\; One day when he'd almost be smushed by a cow.\; He soared to fields near his cozy barn\; Guided by a dream of an important quest.
pause 20

put sing matter-of-factly In that field was a mustang, proud and sure\; And our chicken friend landed, avoiding manure.\; The mustang snorted, upset by the intrusion\; But the chicken remained, standing his ground.
pause 20

put sing matter-of-factly "You have a purpose, greater than this:\; Running in fields while things are amiss!\; A king will go to battle to protect these lands,\; Without you beneath him he will fall, alas."
pause 20

put sing matter-of-factly The mustang retorted, "I have no care for this king,\; No one will rule me, I'll not be a gelding."\; With a huff and rush he tore at the chicken,\; With mud flying up behind his galloping hooves.
pause 20

put sing matter-of-factly The chicken was quicker, with warrior-like skills\; He flew off to the side, his voice in a trill,\; "But if you do not, and army will come.\; They will tame you or slay you, and meat you'll become."
pause 20

put sing matter-of-factly The mustang slowed, almost imperceptibly slower\; A meal, or a slave, to neither he would lower\; Himself to become. His proud heritage of freedom\; Was at war with survival, and he faltered and slowed to a trot.
pause 20

put sing matter-of-factly A week later, the chicken pecked at the ground\; Looking for kernels of corn strewn all around.\; The young kitten knew naught of his grand adventures,\; How he'd tamed the wild mustang and save all the land.
pause 20

put sing matter-of-factly The king rode into history upon a horse made famous\; For in battle, none could shake their shared trust\; A legion they slew, with incredible speed did they fall.\; Who stared at the kings banners, chickens on all.
pause 20
