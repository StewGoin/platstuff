The rope's will quickly fades away, and your grip on the rope doesn't hinder gravity from bringing you and the rope tumbling to the ground.
You finish practicing your climbing skill just as your rope begins to slacken.  You step gracefully back onto the ground as the remainder of rope falls around you.


# fail start
Tossing one end of the rope over your shoulder, you mime a convincing climb while pulling the rope hand over hand.

# good start
Directing your attention toward your rope, the ends immediate begin twitching.  The rope suddenly unfurls itself completly, moving in pace with the music.  You hang on tightly as a shimmering thrashing rope finishes its transformation, and reaching up with your free hand you begin to climb.
