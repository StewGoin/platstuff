put recite 'The Traitor's Guild'
pause 5

put sing quietly Trudging paths from Claw to Clan,\;Few that walk less understand:\;When winds blow bitter, cold and wet...\;Even winning odds on the longest bet...\;A Trader's life can be rich in lonliness.
pause 15

put sing coldly Faithful friends of theirs walk daily,\;Though conversation they grasp just barely.\;A mottled Yak, two stubborn mules...\;This singing Bard, or other fools...\;Where are we to earn their friendship?
pause 15

put sing sadly Some plats they lose here and there,\;In desperate hope of satisfying wares.\;Truly called the stingiest guild...\;By us who should bear honest guilt...\;For is not a friend worth an anla's walking?
pause 15

put sing regretfully From shore to shore we've sailed in joy,\;Often in search of some new toy.\;Exchanging friendship for momentary fluff...\;We sell our souls to own more stuff...\;Have you become a member as I?
